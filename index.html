        <p>The POCV's purpose is to demonstrate that the Raspberry Pi (<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">http://www.raspberrypi.org</a>) can support the multiple systems needed to maintain long-term autonomous operations on water.</p>

<p>The POCV will be battery powered, and only run the bare essentials needed to navigate the craft on a small body of water, a lake for example. The RPi will be tasked with running the Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) which in turn manages the electric motor, taking GPS positioning information and combining that with waypoint and route information to calculate the rudder commands to navigate the POCV to predetermined locations, and take photographs and or video during its test missions.</p>

<p>A base-station complete with LCD, keyboard, mouse, USB hub, and an extension for the network port will be used with the POCV. The base-station will be connected to the POCV using an umbilical. </p>

<p>A GPS, Temperature Sensor, Servo Controller Board, and Compass module will be managed through the iÂ²c bus through the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. A USB camera, or camera module will also be part of the POCV's hardware package.</p>
